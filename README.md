## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- min() & clamp()
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest challenge in this challenge ðŸ¤¨ was to make this transition between the mobile and desktop view, especially the image which was stretching the preview downstairs and fitting almost the whole space ðŸ¤§

```css
.preview {
  ...
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  ...
}
```

I've been looking for so long to find a solution to that. Now I'll use it almost everywhere because of the effect ðŸ‘ŒðŸ”¥

### Continued development

I think I'll focus on how to use the 'flex-wrap' property because I still don't feel it.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-tricks - responsive images css](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-css/) - This helped me for setting the two versions of the same image.
